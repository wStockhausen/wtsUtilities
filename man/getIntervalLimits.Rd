\title{Get interval limits (cut points) from a vector of midpoints}
\usage{
getIntervalLimits(xs)
}
\arguments{
\item{xs}{\itemize{
\item the vector of interval midpoints
}}
}
\value{
the vector of interval limits (cutpoints)
}
\description{
Function to return a vector of interval limits from a vector of midpoints.
}
\details{
Assumes interval limits are midway between coordinates in xs. First
and last coordinates assume same widths as first and last cells. Resulting vector
has nx+1 values, if xs has nx values.
